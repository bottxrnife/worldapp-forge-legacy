/**
 * onchain_service — read the user's loyalty from ENS text records (sponsor: ENS).
 *
 * This is the "Most Creative Use of ENS" pattern: arbitrary app state (a loyalty
 * punch card) is stored as a verifiable credential inside an ENSIP-5 text record,
 * keyed off the user's portable ENS identity rather than a private database.
 *
 * Pure viem ENS, no third-party subname service: reverse-resolve the wallet to
 * its primary ENS name (via the mainnet Universal Resolver), then read the
 * `dappdock.loyalty` text record (JSON map of dappEns → { punches, points,
 * redeemed }). Users opt in by setting that record on their own name (e.g. in
 * the ENS manager app, or any ENSIP-5 resolver / CCIP-Read gateway they control)
 * — the in-app burner wallet can't write records on a name it doesn't own
 * without an on-chain transaction, so the local SecureStore cache stays the
 * writable source of truth and ENS is the read-through identity overlay. No API
 * key; safe no-op when the wallet has no primary name or no such record.
